# go-web-terminal
Simple terminal accessible from the web. 

Note:- This program can be used to access linux terminal from the web (running on port 8088) in an unauthenticated manner, So it should not be used in any production or any sensitive network infrastructure. (I made this program for a small personal project)

To run this program simply run `go run main.go`

You can also get the docker image from here `docker pull hac10101/go-terminal`

Checkout release page if you want to get the compiled binary.
